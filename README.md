### Ice Cream Revenue Prediction
#### Overview
This project focuses on predicting daily revenue for an ice cream business based on the outside air temperature. A Linear Regression model is implemented to estimate the relationship between temperature and revenue.

#### Dataset
The dataset consists of two columns:

Independent Variable (X): Outside Air Temperature (in degrees Celsius).
Dependent Variable (Y): Overall daily revenue generated in dollars.
#### Project Structure
IceCreamModel.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and predictions.
IceCreamData.csv: CSV file containing the dataset.
